This project was created by using ReactJS, material-ui and semantic-ui libraries and it is responsive for different page sizes.

In main page, you can see the products that fetched by 'fakestoreapi' api, navbar and footer sections.

Under every product you will see a 'add-to-shpping-cart' icon and 'view-details' button. When you click the icon you can add the product to cart-page and badge of the shopping-cart icon in navbar will increase. When you click view-details button, it will direct you to details page where you can see the details(title, description, price, category) of the product.

On hover shopping-cart-icon, you can see the list of products in cart. If you don't have any item in your cart, you will see a descriptive message that says 'you don't have any item in your cart!'

When you click menu item in navbar, there will appear a sidebar from left. There are four categories and two dummy links. When you click a category, products in that category will appear on your main page.

When you click checkout button in navbar, it will direct you to cart-page. In cart-page, you can see all items in your cart and you can remove any of them.

NOTE: In interview question criterias, it is mentioned that design is not a part of it so not much time spent designing the page. On the other hand, clean code and organized layout took into consideration.
